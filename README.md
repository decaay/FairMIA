Code for paper "FairMIA: Fairness-Aware Membership Inference Attack for Privacy Risk Auditing"

In this paper,we theoretically and empirically reveal that performance differences in MIAs arise from different memorization across classes, where classes with higher memorization are more susceptible to inference. Motivated by this insight, we propose Fairness-Aware Membership Inference Attack (FairMIA) method achieves higher overallattack performance, smaller performance gaps between classes, and remains effective under different defense settings.
